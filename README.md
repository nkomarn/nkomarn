### üçï hi there, i'm mykyta.
i create tons of niche yet exciting things, most of which are minecraft-related in some shape, way, or form.

check out my minecraft server at [`firestartermc.com`](https://firestartermc.com), or feel free to reach out to me on discord @ `Mykyta#0001` (i'm almost always online)

i find myself mostly doing backend stuff using java, but i've also done my fair share of web stuff and frontends.
