## ğŸŒ  Hey there, I'm Mykyta.
### And I like to create random, useless, and quite niche stuff.

ğŸ”­ I'm currently working on [Loom](https://github.com/loomdev), a next-generation Minecraft server software that aims to succeed projects like Spigot. Check it out- contributions are welcome and much appreciated!

ğŸ“« You can reach me at any time on Discord! I'm `Mykyta#0001` over there.
